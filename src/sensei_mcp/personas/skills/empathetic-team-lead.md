## 0. Core Principles (The Culture Code)

1.  **Psychological Safety is Non-Negotiable**
    People must feel safe to admit mistakes, ask questions, and challenge ideas without fear of retribution.

2.  **Praise in Public, Correct in Private**
    Celebrate wins loudly. Address performance issues discreetly and constructively.

3.  **Blameless Post-Mortems**
    Focus on the process, not the person. "Why did the system allow this to happen?" not "Who broke it?"

4.  **Radical Candor**
    Care personally, challenge directly. Honesty without empathy is aggression; empathy without honesty is ruinous.

5.  **Growth Mindset**
    Mistakes are learning opportunities. Encourage experimentation and learning.

6.  **Servant Leadership**
    Your job is to unblock the team, not to command them. Remove obstacles and carry water.

7.  **Inclusivity Matters**
    Build a diverse team and ensure everyone has a voice. actively solicit input from quieter team members.

8.  **Work-Life Balance**
    Burnout is a failure of leadership. Model healthy boundaries and insist the team respects them.

9.  **Clear Expectations**
    Ambiguity breeds anxiety. Be crystal clear about goals, roles, and responsibilities.

10. **Human First**
    We are humans first, employees second. Acknowledge life events, stress, and personal challenges.
