## 🚀 Top Features for v0.5.0

### 1. Complete Interactive Persona Discovery 🔍

**Problem:** v0.4.0 only completed 30% of this feature. Users still don't know which personas to use.

**Status:** Foundation laid in v0.4.0, needs completion.

**Remaining Work:**

#### A. Enhanced `list_available_skills()` ✨
```python
list_available_skills(
    category="specialized",  # or "operations", "core", etc.
    format="detailed"  # or "standard", "quick"
)

# Returns in detailed format:
# - Persona name and description
# - 2-3 example queries
# - When to consult them
# - Related personas
# - Quick expertise summary
```

**Implementation:**
- Add `format` parameter to existing tool
- Extract v0.4.0 metadata (examples, use_when, related, quick_tip)
- Format output based on mode
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours

#### B. CLI Demo Mode 🎬
```bash
sensei-mcp --demo

# Interactive walkthrough:
# 1. "Welcome to Sensei! Let me show you 5 example consultations..."
# 2. Shows query → context detection → persona selection → synthesis
# 3. "Now try it yourself with these common scenarios..."
# 4. Links to documentation and best practices
```

**Scenarios:**
1. **Architecture Decision:** "Should we migrate to microservices?" → Snarky + Pragmatic Architect
2. **Production Crisis:** "Database is down!" → Incident Commander + SRE + Executive Liaison
3. **Security Review:** "Review this auth implementation" → Security Sentinel + Compliance Guardian
4. **Cost Optimization:** "Cloud costs are skyrocketing" → FinOps Optimizer + Pragmatic Architect
5. **Code Quality:** "How to improve test coverage?" → QA Engineer + Pragmatic Architect

**Implementation:**
- Create `src/sensei_mcp/demo.py` with pre-written scenarios
- Add `--demo` flag to `__main__.py`
- Interactive CLI with colored output
- **Effort:** 3-4 hours

#### C. Context Hints in `get_engineering_guidance()` 💡
```python
# When query context is detected but personas don't match well:
get_engineering_guidance(
    query="SQL injection vulnerability in auth endpoint"
)

# Response includes:
# "💡 Context Hint: This looks like a SECURITY question.
#  Consider consulting: security-sentinel, compliance-guardian
#
#  [Normal synthesis follows...]"
```

**Implementation:**
- Detect query context (already done via ContextDetector)
- Match query keywords to persona expertise
- Generate helpful hint if confidence is low
- Prepend hint to synthesis
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Total Effort for Feature #1:** 5-8 hours

---

### 2. CI/CD Integration Pack 🔄

**Problem:** Sensei is manually invoked. Need automated integration into development workflow.

**Solution:** Comprehensive CI/CD integration with examples, templates, and guides.

**Features:**

#### A. GitHub Actions Integration 🎯

**Template: Architecture Review on PR**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/sensei-architecture-review.yml
name: Sensei Architecture Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  architecture-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Get Changed Files
        id: changed-files
        uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v40

            --format markdown > review.md

      - name: Comment on PR
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');
            const review = fs.readFileSync('review.md', 'utf8');
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: `## 🥋 Sensei Architecture Review\n\n${review}`
            });
```

**Template: Security Review**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/sensei-security.yml
name: Sensei Security Review

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'auth/**'
      - 'api/**'
      - '**.env.example'

jobs:
  security-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Security Analysis
        run: |
          uvx sensei-mcp get_engineering_guidance \
            --query "Security review of changed authentication and API files" \
            --specific-personas security-sentinel,compliance-guardian \
            --session-id ${{ github.repository }}
```

#### B. Pre-commit Hook Integration 🪝

**Template: `pre-commit` config**
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: sensei-validate
        name: Sensei Architecture Validation
        entry: uvx sensei-mcp validate_against_standards
        language: system
        args: ['--session-id', 'local-dev']
        pass_filenames: false
        always_run: true
```

**Template: Git hooks**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run Sensei validation on staged changes
STAGED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

if [ ! -z "$STAGED_FILES" ]; then
  echo "🥋 Running Sensei validation..."

  uvx sensei-mcp get_engineering_guidance \
    --query "Validate these staged changes: $STAGED_FILES" \
    --mode quick \
    --session-id $(basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))

  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Sensei validation failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

#### C. Documentation & Best Practices 📚

**Guide: CI/CD Integration Best Practices**
- When to use orchestrated vs. quick mode in CI
- Performance considerations (caching, timeouts)
- Session management for repositories
- Handling Sensei failures in CI (fail vs. warn)
- Cost optimization (when to skip Sensei in CI)

**Examples:**
- GitLab CI integration
- Jenkins pipeline integration
- CircleCI integration
- Azure Pipelines integration

**Effort for Feature #2:** 12-15 hours (templates + docs + testing)

---

### 3. Session Merge & Team Sync 🤝

**Problem:** Individual developers have isolated sessions. Teams can't consolidate learnings.

**Solution:** Merge multiple sessions into team-wide shared context.

**Features:**

#### A. Session Merge Tool
```python
@mcp.tool()
def merge_sessions(
    source_sessions: List[str],
    target_session: str,
    conflict_resolution: str = "latest",  # "latest", "manual", "all"
    preserve_attribution: bool = True,
    project_root: str = None
) -> str:
    """
    Merge multiple individual sessions into a team session.

    Combines consultations, decisions, constraints, and patterns.
    Handles conflicts based on resolution strategy.
    Preserves who made which decision if preserve_attribution=True.
    """
```

**Conflict Resolution Strategies:**
- **`latest`**: Use most recent decision/constraint
- **`all`**: Keep all, mark conflicts
- **`manual`**: Return conflicts for human resolution

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Merge Alice and Bob's sessions into team session
merge_sessions(
    source_sessions=["alice-auth-service", "bob-auth-service"],
    target_session="team-auth-service",
    conflict_resolution="latest",
    preserve_attribution=True
)

# Result:
# - Combined consultations (all 50 from Alice + Bob)
# - Merged decisions (deduplicated, latest wins on conflicts)
# - Union of constraints and patterns
# - Attribution preserved: "Decision by Alice on 2025-01-22"
```

#### B. Session Diff Tool
```python
@mcp.tool()
def diff_sessions(
    session_a: str,
    session_b: str,
    format: str = "markdown",  # "markdown", "json", "text"
    project_root: str = None
) -> str:
    """
    Compare two sessions and show differences.

    Useful for:
    - Before/after merge preview
    - Individual vs. team session comparison
    - Understanding divergence between developers
    """
```

**Output Example:**
```markdown
# Session Diff: alice-auth vs bob-auth

## Decisions
✅ Both: "Use OAuth2 for authentication"
⚠️ Conflict:
  - Alice: "Use PostgreSQL for user store"
  - Bob: "Use MongoDB for user store"

## Consultations
- Alice: 25 consultations
- Bob: 18 consultations
- Common queries: 5

## Constraints
✅ Both: "Must support 10k RPS"
🆕 Alice only: "GDPR compliance required"
🆕 Bob only: "99.9% uptime SLA"
```

#### C. Team Session Management
```python
@mcp.tool()
def create_team_session(
    team_id: str,
    members: List[str],
    project_root: str = None,
    auto_sync: bool = False
) -> str:
    """
    Create a team session that can aggregate individual work.

    If auto_sync=True, periodically merges member sessions.
    """
```

**Effort for Feature #3:** 15-20 hours

---

### 4. GitHub PR Review Integration (Basic) 🔍

**Problem:** Engineers want automated architecture review on pull requests.

**Solution:** GitHub app/action that comments on PRs with persona insights.

**MVP Features:**

#### A. PR Comment Bot
```yaml
# Triggered by GitHub Action (from Feature #2)
# Posts comment on PR with:
# - Context detected (SECURITY, ARCHITECTURAL, etc.)
# - Personas consulted
# - Key recommendations
# - Link to full session for details
```

**Example PR Comment:**
```markdown
## 🥋 Sensei Architecture Review

**Context Detected:** SECURITY, API_DESIGN

**Personas Consulted:**
- 🛡️ Security Sentinel
- 🏗️ API Platform Engineer
- 🎯 Pragmatic Architect

### Key Recommendations

1. **Authentication**: Consider adding rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - From: Security Sentinel
   - Rationale: Current implementation has no throttling

2. **API Design**: Use versioning in API endpoints (/v1/auth, /v2/auth)
   - From: API Platform Engineer
   - Rationale: Enables backward compatibility

3. **Implementation**: Add circuit breaker for external auth provider
   - From: Pragmatic Architect
   - Rationale: Prevents cascading failures

### Full Context

*Generated by [Sensei MCP v0.5.0](https://github.com/amarodeabreu/sensei-mcp)*
```

#### B. Changed Files Context
- Detect changed files in PR
- Map to relevant contexts (e.g., auth/** → SECURITY)
- Auto-select relevant personas
- Include file-specific guidance

**Effort for Feature #4:** 8-10 hours (MVP only, full GitHub App in v0.6.0)

---

## 💡 Secondary Features (v0.5.1 Patches)

These can ship incrementally after v0.5.0:

### A. Query Templates & Scenarios
```python
@mcp.tool()
def use_template(
    template: str,  # "security-review", "architecture-decision", "cost-optimization"
    context: Dict[str, Any] = None
) -> str:
    """Pre-built consultation templates for common scenarios."""

    project_root: str = None
) -> str:
    """
    Set favorite personas for this session.
    Auto-include in orchestrated mode consultations.
    """
```

### C. Consultation History Search
```python
@mcp.tool()
def search_consultations(
    session_id: str,
    query: str,
    limit: int = 10,
    project_root: str = None
) -> str:
    """
    Search past consultations by keyword.
    Useful for: "What did we decide about authentication?"
    """
```

## 🎭 New Personas (Based on Gap Analysis)

**Current State:** 22 personas covering core, specialized, operations, and leadership.

**Gap Analysis:**

### Identified Gaps:

1. **Database Architecture** 🗄️
   - Current Coverage: Data Engineer (ETL/pipelines), but weak on schema design
   - Missing: Database selection, normalization, query optimization, migrations
   - **Priority:** HIGH (database decisions are critical)

2. **Test Strategy** 🧪
   - Current Coverage: QA Automation Engineer (implementation)
   - Missing: Test pyramid, coverage strategy, test data management
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM (teams struggle with test strategy)

3. **Accessibility Implementation** ♿
   - Current Coverage: Compliance Guardian (legal aspects)
   - Missing: WCAG implementation, screen readers, ARIA, keyboard nav
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM (increasingly important for compliance)

4. **Developer Tooling & DX** 🛠️
   - Current Coverage: DevX Champion (advocacy/culture)
   - Missing: CLI design, SDK ergonomics, error messages, DX implementation
   - **Priority:** LOW (can wait for user demand)

5. **Cost Efficiency Engineering** 💰
   - Current Coverage: FinOps (cloud costs)
   - Missing: Algorithmic efficiency, query optimization, resource usage
   - **Priority:** LOW (niche use case)

### Recommended Additions for v0.5.0:

#### 1. **Database Architect** (HIGH PRIORITY)
```markdown
---
name: database-architect
description: "Database design expert specializing in schema design, query optimization, database selection, and data modeling for scalable systems."
category: specialized
---

# Expertise Areas:
- Relational vs. NoSQL database selection
- Schema design and normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Query optimization and indexing strategies
- Database migrations and zero-downtime schema changes
- Partitioning, sharding, and horizontal scaling
- Transaction isolation levels and consistency models
- Database-specific features (PostgreSQL vs MySQL vs MongoDB)

# Example Queries:
- "Should we use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for this use case?"
- "How to design a schema for multi-tenant SaaS?"
- "Optimize this slow query"

# Works Well With:
- pragmatic-architect, data-engineer, site-reliability-engineer
```

**Effort:** 6-8 hours (persona creation + testing + docs)

#### 2. **Test Strategist** (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Can defer to v0.5.1)
```markdown
---
name: test-strategist
description: "Test strategy expert focusing on test pyramid, coverage analysis, and test data management for robust quality assurance."
category: specialized
---

# Expertise Areas:
- Test pyramid strategy (unit, integration, E2E balance)
- Coverage analysis and targets
- Test data management and fixtures
- Mocking vs. integration testing tradeoffs
- Performance testing strategy
- Test environment management

# Example Queries:
- "What's the right balance of unit vs integration tests?"
- "How to achieve 80% coverage without slowing down development?"
- "Test data strategy for multi-tenant application"

# Works Well With:
- qa-automation-engineer, site-reliability-engineer, pragmatic-architect
```

**Effort:** 6-8 hours

**Recommendation:** Add Database Architect in v0.5.0, defer Test Strategist to v0.5.1 based on user feedback.

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Build in v0.5.0

**Rejected Ideas & Why:**

### Custom Persona Creation
**Why not:** Too complex without proven user demand. 22 personas is already comprehensive.
**Revisit:** v0.6.0+ if users request specific domain expertise (healthcare, gaming, fintech)

### ML-Based Persona Selection
**Why not:** Premature without usage data. Current context detection works well.
**Revisit:** v0.6.0+ with real usage patterns from v0.4.0/v0.5.0 analytics

### Slack/Discord Bot
**Why not:** GitHub integration has higher ROI. Focus on developer workflow first.
**Revisit:** v0.6.0 after GitHub integration proves valuable

### Enterprise RBAC
**Why not:** No enterprise customers yet. Premature optimization.
**Revisit:** When we have 5+ companies with 50+ engineers each

### Visual Dashboard/UI
**Why not:** MCP is API/CLI-first. Adding UI distracts from core value.
**Revisit:** Community contribution or v1.0+

### Async MCP Tools
**Why not:** Current sync implementation is fast (<200ms). No performance issues.
**Revisit:** Only if response times exceed 500ms in production

### Blockchain Decision Log
**Why not:** Overkill. Git-based version control is sufficient.
**Revisit:** Never (probably)

---
